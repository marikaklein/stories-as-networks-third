    <br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">...and <del>I</del> hung up the phone.</span>
<span class="test">Immediately <del>I</del> recollected the voice that had spoken in German.</span>
<span class="test">It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all <del>our</del> work and — though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to <del>me</del> — of <del>our</del> lives also.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>His</mark> being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered.</span>
<span class="test">Before the sun set on this same day, <del>I</del> ran the same risk.</span>
<span class="test">Madden was implacable.</span>
<span class="test">Rather, to be more accurate, <mark>he</mark> was obliged to be implacable.</span>
<span class="test">An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could <mark>he</mark> fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> went up to <del>my</del> bedroom.</span>
<span class="test">Absurd though the gesture was, <del>I</del> closed and locked the door.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> threw <del>myself</del> down on <del>my</del> narrow iron bed, and waited on <del>my</del> back.</span>
<span class="test">The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky.</span>
<span class="test">It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of <del>my</del> implacable death.</span>
<span class="test">In despite of <del>my</del> dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was <del>I</del> to die now?</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Then <del>I</del> reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. </span>
<span class="test">Century follows century, and things happen only in the present.</span>
<span class="test">There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to <del>me</del> ...</span>
<span class="test">The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">In the midst of <del>my</del> hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to <del>me</del> to speak of terror, now that <del>I</del> have outwitted Richard Madden, now that <del>my</del> neck hankers for the hangman's noose), <del>I</del> knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that <del>I</del> possessed the Secret — the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre.</span>
<span class="test">A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, <del>I</del> turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs.</span>
<span class="test">If only <del>my</del> mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany ...</span>
<span class="test"><del>My</del> voice, <del>my</del> human voice, was weak.</span>
<span class="test">How could it reach the ear of the Chief?</span>
<span class="test">The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of <del>me</del> except that <del>we</del> were in Staffordshire.</span>
<span class="test">A man who, sitting in <mark>his</mark> arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from <del>us</del>.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> said aloud, "<del>I</del> must flee."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test">Something — perhaps merely a desire to prove <del>my</del> total penury to <del>myself</del> — made <del>me</del> empty out <del>my</del> pockets.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> found just what <del>I</del> knew <del>I</del> was going to find.</span>
<span class="test">The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which <del>I</del> decided to destroy at once (and which <del>I</del> did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief — and a revolver with a single bullet.</span>
<span class="test">Absurdly <del>I</del> held it and weighed it in <del>my</del> hand, to give <del>myself</del> courage.</span>
<span class="test">Vaguely <del>I</del> thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">In ten minutes <del>I</del> had developed <del>my</del> plan.</span>
<span class="test">The telephone directory gave <del>me</del> the name of the one person capable of passing on the information.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> am a timorous man.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> can say it now, now that <del>I</del> have brought <del>my</del> incredibly risky plan to an end.</span>
<span class="test">It was not easy to bring about, and <del>I</del> know that its execution was terrible.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> did not do it for Germany — no!</span>
<span class="test">Such a barbarous country is of no importance to <del>me</del>, particularly since it had degraded <del>me</del> by making <del>me</del> become a spy.</span>
<span class="test">Furthermore, <del>I</del> knew an Englishman — a modest man — who, for <del>me</del>, is as great as Goethe.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> did not speak with <mark>him</mark> for more than an hour, but during that time, <mark>he</mark> was Goethe.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> carried out <del>my</del> plan because <del>I</del> felt the Chief had some fear of those of <del>my</del> race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> wished to prove to <mark>him</mark> that a yellow man could save <mark>his</mark> armies.</span>
<span class="test">Besides, <del>I</del> had to escape the Captain.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>His</mark> hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at <del>my</del> door.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Silently, <del>I</del> dressed, took leave of <del>myself</del> in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out.</span>
<span class="test">The station was not far from <del>my</del> house, but <del>I</del> thought it more prudent to take a cab.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> told <del>myself</del> that <del>I</del> thus ran less chance of being recognized.</span>
<span class="test">The truth is that, in the deserted street, <del>I</del> felt infinitely visible and vulnerable.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> recall that <del>I</del> told the driver to stop short of the main entrance.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on.</span>
<span class="test">The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine.</span>
<span class="test">There was almost no one on the platform.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> walked through the carriages.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">At last the train pulled out.</span>
<span class="test">A man <del>I</del> recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform.</span>
<span class="test">It was Captain Richard Madden.</span>
<span class="test">Shattered, trembling, <del>I</del> huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">From utter terror <del>I</del> passed into a state of almost abject happiness.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> told <del>myself</del> that the duel had already started and that <del>I</del> had won the first encounter by besting <del>my</del> adversary in <mark>his</mark> first attack — even if it was only for forty minutes — by an accident of fate.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, <del>I</del> would be in prison or dead.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> argued, with no less sophism, that <del>my</del> timorous happiness was proof that <del>I</del> was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion.</span>
<span class="test">From <del>my</del> weakness <del>I</del> drew strength that never left <del>me</del>.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> foresee that man will resign <mark>himself</mark> each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left.</span>
<span class="test">To <mark>them</mark> <del>I</del> offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon <mark>himself</mark> a future as irrevocable as the past.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Thus <del>I</del> proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, <del>I</del> contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be <del>my</del> last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees.</span>
<span class="test">It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field.</span>
<span class="test">No one called the name of a station.</span>
<span class="test">"Ashgrove?" <del>I</del> asked some children on the platform.</span>
<span class="test">"Ashgrove," <mark>they</mark> replied.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> got out.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow.</span>
<span class="test">One of <mark>them</mark> asked <del>me</del>: "Are <del>you</del> going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"</span>
<span class="test">Without waiting for <del>my</del> answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but <del>you</del> won't get lost if <del>you</del> take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad."</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> threw <mark>them</mark> a coin (<del>my</del> last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road.</span>
<span class="test">At a slight incline, the road ran downhill.</span>
<span class="test">It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep <del>me</del> company.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">For a moment <del>I</del> thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined <del>my</del> desperate intent.</span>
<span class="test">At once <del>I</del> realized that this would be impossible.</span>
<span class="test">The advice about turning always to the left reminded <del>me</del> that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> know something about labyrinths.</span>
<span class="test">Not for nothing am <del>I</del> the great grandson of Ts'ui Pen.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose <mark>themselves</mark>.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before <mark>he</mark> was assassinated by a stranger.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>His</mark> novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found <mark>his</mark> labyrinth.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Under the trees of England <del>I</del> meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain;</span> 
<span class="test"><del>I</del> imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea;</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ...</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Lost in these imaginary illusions <del>I</del> forgot <del>my</del> destiny — that of the hunted.</span>
<span class="test">For an undetermined period of time <del>I</del> felt <del>myself</del> cut off from the world, an abstract spectator.</span>
<span class="test">The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test">Going down the gently sloping road <del>I</del> could not feel fatigue.</span>
<span class="test">The evening was at once intimate and infinite.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight.</span>
<span class="test">A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Meditating thus <del>I</del> arrived at a high, rusty iron gate.</span>
<span class="test">Through the railings <del>I</del> could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.</span>
<span class="test">Two things dawned on <del>me</del> at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese.</span>
<span class="test">That was why <del>I</del> had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether <del>I</del> attracted attention by clapping <del>my</del> hands.</span>
<span class="test">The stuttering sparks of the music kept on.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was criss crossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon.</span>
<span class="test">A tall man carried it.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> could not see <mark>his</mark> face for the light blinded <del>me</del>.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><mark>He</mark> opened the gate and spoke slowly in <del>my</del> language.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"<del>I</del> see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled <mark>himself</mark> to see to relieving <del>my</del> solitude. No doubt <del>you</del> want to see the garden?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Recognizing the name of one of <del>our</del> consuls, <del>I</del> replied, somewhat taken aback.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The garden?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The garden of forking paths."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Something stirred in <del>my</del> memory and <del>I</del> said, with incomprehensible assurance: "The garden of <del>my</del> ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"<del>Your</del> ancestor? <del>Your</del> illustrious ancestor? Come in."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The damp path zigzagged like those of <del>my</del> childhood.</span>
<span class="test">When <del>we</del> reached the house, <del>we</del> went into a library filled with books from both East and West.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> recognized some large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>They</mark> had never been printed.</span>
<span class="test">A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> remember also a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which <del>our</del> potters copied from the Persians ...</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Stephen Albert was watching <del>me</del> with a smile on <mark>his</mark> face.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> was, as <del>I</del> have said, remarkably tall.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>His</mark> face was deeply lined and <mark>he</mark> had gray eyes and a gray beard.</span>
<span class="test">There was about <mark>him</mark> something of the priest, and something of the sailor.</span>
<span class="test">Later, <mark>he</mark> told <del>me</del> <mark>he</mark> had been a missionary in Tientsin before <mark>he</mark> "had aspired to become a Sinologist.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>We</del> sat down, <del>I</del> upon a large, low divan, <mark>he</mark> with <mark>his</mark> back to the window and to a large circular clock.</span>
<span class="test">I calculated that <del>my</del> pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour.</span>
<span class="test"><del>My</del> irrevocable decision could wait.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen — Governor of <mark>his</mark> native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher.</span>
<span class="test">Yet <mark>he</mark> abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut <mark>himself</mark> up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years.</span>
<span class="test">At <mark>his</mark> death, <mark>his</mark> heirs found only a mess of manuscripts.</span>
<span class="test">The family, as <del>you</del> doubtless know, wished to consign <mark>them</mark> to the fire, but the executor of the estate — a Taoist or a Buddhist monk — insisted on <mark>their</mark> publication."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," <del>I</del> replied, "still curse the memory of that monk.</span>
<span class="test">Such a publication was madness.</span>
<span class="test">The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth <mark>he</mark> is alive.</span>
<span class="test">As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... <mark>his</mark> Labyrinth ..."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, lacquered writing cabinet.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"An ivory labyrinth?" <del>I</del> exclaimed.</span>
<span class="test">"A tiny labyrinth indeed ... !"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"A symbolic labyrinth," <mark>he</mark> corrected <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test">"An invisible labyrinth of time.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del>, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery.</span>
<span class="test">After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened.</span>
<span class="test">At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; '<del>I</del> am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, '<del>I</del> am retiring to construct a maze.'</span>
<span class="test">Everyone assumed these were separate activities.</span>
<span class="test">No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same.</span>
<span class="test">The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden.</span>
<span class="test">This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to <del>your</del> family, no one could find the labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test">The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Two circumstances showed <del>me</del> the direct solution to the problem.</span>
<span class="test">First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which <del>I</del> discovered."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Albert rose.</span>
<span class="test">For a few moments <mark>he</mark> turned <mark>his</mark> back to <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> returned holding in <mark>his</mark> hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular.</span>
<span class="test">Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous.</span>
<span class="test">Eagerly, but without understanding, <del>I</del> read the words which a man of <del>my</del> own blood had written with a small brush: "<del>I</del> leave to various future times, but not to all, <del>my</del> garden of forking paths."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> handed back the sheet of paper in silence.</span>
<span class="test">Albert went on: "Before <del>I</del> discovered this letter, <del>I</del> kept asking <del>myself</del> how a book could be infinite.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular.</span>
<span class="test">A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of <mark>her</mark> copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which <mark>she</mark> will relate it, and thus on to infinity.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of <mark>his</mark> elders.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"These conjectures gave <del>me</del> amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen.</span>
<span class="test">At this point, <del>I</del> was sent from Oxford the manuscript <del>you</del> have just seen.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Naturally, <del>my</del> attention was caught by the sentence, '<del>I</del> leave to various future times, but not to all, <del>my</del> garden of forking paths: <del>I</del> had no sooner read this, than <del>I</del> understood.</span>
<span class="test">The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself.</span>
<span class="test">The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space.</span>
<span class="test">Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory.</span>
<span class="test">In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives <mark>he</mark> chooses one at the expense of the others.</span>
<span class="test">In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, <mark>he</mark> chooses — simultaneously — all of them.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> thus creates various futures, various times which start others that will in <mark>their</mark> turn branch out and bifurcate in other times.</span>
<span class="test">This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Fang, let <del>us</del> say, has a secret.</span>
<span class="test">A stranger knocks at <mark>his</mark> door.</span>
<span class="test">Fang makes up <mark>his</mark> mind to kill <mark>him</mark>.</span>
<span class="test">Naturally there are various possible outcomes.</span>
<span class="test">Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on.</span>
<span class="test">In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations.</span>
<span class="test">Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.</span>
<span class="test">For example, <del>you</del> come to this house; but in other possible pasts <del>you</del> are <del>my</del> enemy; in others <del>my</del> friend.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"If <del>you</del> will put up with <del>my</del> atrocious pronunciation, <del>I</del> would like to read <del>you</del> a few pages of <del>your</del> ancestor's work."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><mark>His</mark> countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">With slow precision, <mark>he</mark> read two versions of the same epic chapter.</span>
<span class="test">In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass.</span>
<span class="test">The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so <mark>they</mark> won the battle easily.</span>
<span class="test">In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress.</span>
<span class="test">The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">With proper veneration <del>I</del> listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less admiration for <mark>them</mark> in <mark>themselves</mark> than for the fact that <mark>they</mark> had been thought out by one of <del>my</del> own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given <mark>them</mark> back to <del>me</del>, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>They</mark> were resigned to killing and to dying."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">At that moment <del>I</del> felt within <del>me</del> and around <del>me</del> something invisible and intangible pullulating.</span>
<span class="test">It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by <mark>them</mark> in some way.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Stephen Albert continued: "<del>I</del> do not think that <del>your</del> illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> do not find it believable that <mark>he</mark> would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric.</span>
<span class="test">In <del>your</del> country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one.</span>
<span class="test">Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but <mark>he</mark> was also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered <mark>himself</mark> more than a mere novelist.</span>
<span class="test">The testimony of <mark>his</mark> contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of <mark>his</mark> life confirm <mark>his</mark> leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical.</span>
<span class="test">Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of <mark>his</mark> novel.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> know that of all problems, none disquieted <mark>him</mark> more, and none concerned <mark>him</mark> more than the profound one of time.</span>
<span class="test">Now then, this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> does not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;"><del>I</del> proposed various solutions, all of <mark>them</mark> inadequate.</span>
<span class="test"><del>We</del> discussed them.</span>
<span class="test">Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is the only one prohibited?"</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> thought for a moment and then replied: "The word is chess."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Precisely," said Albert.</span>
<span class="test">"The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time.</span>
<span class="test">The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself.</span>
<span class="test">To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it.</span>
<span class="test">This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of <mark>his</mark> interminable novel.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, <del>I</del> have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, <del>I</del> have worked out the plan from this chaos, <del>I</del> have restored, or believe <del>I</del> have restored, the original.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> have translated the whole work.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> can state categorically that not once has the word time been used in the whole book.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The explanation is obvious.</span>
<span class="test">The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be.</span>
<span class="test">Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, <del>your</del> ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times.</span>
<span class="test">This web of time — the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries — embraces every possibility.</span>
<span class="test"><del>We</del> do not exist in most of them.</span>
<span class="test">In some <del>you</del> exist and not <del>I</del>, while in others <del>I</del> do, and <del>you</del> do not, and in yet others both of <del>us</del> exist.</span>
<span class="test">In this one, in which chance has favored <del>me</del>, <del>you</del> have come to <del>my</del> gate.</span>
<span class="test">In another, <del>you</del>, crossing the garden, have found <del>me</del> dead.</span>
<span class="test">In yet another, <del>I</del> say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"In all of <mark>them</mark>," <del>I</del> enunciated, with a tremor in <del>my</del> voice.</span>
<span class="test">"<del>I</del> deeply appreciate and am grateful to <del>you</del> for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Not in all," <mark>he</mark> murmured with a smile.</span>
<span class="test">"Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of <mark>them</mark> <del>I</del> am <del>your</del> enemy."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Once again <del>I</del> sensed the pullulation of which <del>I</del> have already spoken.</span>
<span class="test">It seemed to <del>me</del> that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with invisible people.</span>
<span class="test">All were Albert and <del>myself</del>, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> lifted <del>my</del> eyes and the short nightmare disappeared.</span>
<span class="test">In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and <mark>he</mark> was Captain Richard Madden.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The future exists now," <del>I</del> replied.</span>
<span class="test">"But <del>I</del> am <del>your</del> friend. Can <del>I</del> take another look at the letter?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Albert rose from <mark>his</mark> seat.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> stood up tall as <mark>he</mark> opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet.</span>
<span class="test">For a moment <mark>his</mark> back was again turned to <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> had the revolver ready.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> swear that <mark>his</mark> death was instantaneous, as if <mark>he</mark> had been struck by lightning.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">What remains is unreal and unimportant.</span>
<span class="test">Madden broke in and arrested <del>me</del>.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> have been condemned to hang.</span>
<span class="test">Abominably, <del>I</del> have yet triumphed!</span>
<span class="test">The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin.</span>
<span class="test">Yesterday it was bombed.</span>
<span class="test"><del>I</del> read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun.</span>
<span class="test">The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> knew that <del>my</del> problem was to shout, with <del>my</del> feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that <del>I</del> had no other course open to <del>me</del> than to kill someone of that name.</span>
<span class="test"><mark>He</mark> does not know, for no one can, of <del>my</del> infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</span>
